Q2. Why spring boot over spring?

1.Simplified Configuration: Spring Boot offers auto-configuration, eliminating the need for manual XML or Java configurations, making setup faster.

2.Embedded Servers: Spring Boot comes with embedded servers (like Tomcat), allowing you to run applications as standalone JARs, unlike Spring which requires external servers.

3.Rapid Development: With starter dependencies and convention over configuration, Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code and speeds up development.

4.Microservices Support: Spring Boot is ideal for microservices, providing easy setup with minimal configuration and seamless integration with Spring Cloud.

5.Production-Ready Features: It includes Actuator for health checks, metrics, and monitoring out of the box, simplifying production readiness.

6.Externalized Configuration: Spring Boot supports flexible external configurations using application.properties or environment variables.

7.Built-in Testing: Spring Boot provides strong testing support with annotations like @SpringBootTest, simplifying integration testing.

Conclusion: Spring Boot offers faster development, easier configuration, built-in production features, and is better suited for microservices and standalone applications compared to traditional Spring.
